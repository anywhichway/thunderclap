# thunderclap

Thunderclap is an indexed JSON database designed specifically for Cloudflare. It runs on top of the Cloudflare KV store. 
Its query language, [JOQULAR](https://medium.com/@anywhichway/joqular-high-powered-javascript-pattern-matching-273a0d77eab5) 
(JavaScript Object Query Language), is similar to, but more extensive than, the query language associated with MongoDB. 
In addition to having more predicates than MongoDB, JOQULAR extends pattern matching to object properties, e.g.

```
{[/a.*/]:{$eq: 1}} // match all objects with properties starting with the letter "a" containing the value 1
```

Thunderclap also supports role based access control mechanisms and schema or schemaless operation.

Like MongoDB, Thunderclap is open-sourced under the Server Side Public License. This means licencees are free to use and 
modify the code for internal applications or public applications that are not primarily a means of providing Thunderclap
as a hosted service. In order to provide Thunderclap as a hosted service you must either secure a commercial license from 
AnyWhichWay or make all your source code available, including the source of non-derivative works that support the 
monitoring and operation of Thunderclap as a service.

# Important Notes

Thunderclap is currently in ALPHA because:

1) Workers KV from Cloudflare just came out of beta

2) Security measures are incomplete and have not yet been vetted by a third party

3) Although there are many unit tests, application level functional testing has been limited

4) The source code could do with a lot more documentation

5) Project structure does not currently have a clean separation between what people might want to change
for their own use vs submit as a pull request. In general changes to file in the `src` directory are
candidates for pull requests and with the exception of this README those outside are not.

## Installation and Deployment

Clone the repository https://www.github.com/anywhichway/thunderclap.

Run `npm install`.

### Production

NOTE: While the software is in ALPHA state, you should probably not deploy to a production Cloudflare server that
is not behind Cloudflare's paid Access management interface.

When Thunderclap is running in production, it will be available at `thunderclap.<your-domain>`. When it is running in 
development mode, it will be available at `<dev-host-prefix>-thunderclap.<your-domain>`.

You can deploy and use Thunderclap immediately after creating and populating a `thunderclap.json` configuration file
and establishing a CNAME alias `thunderclap` in the Cloudflare DNS control panel. This can just point to your root, 
you do not need a distinct IP address, Cloudflare's smart routers will send requests to the Thunderclap workers.

Create a Cloudflare Workers KV namespace using the Cloudflare Workers control panel. By convention the following 
name form is recommended so that the name parallels the name of thw worker script generated by Thunderclap.

`thunderclap-<primaryHostName>-<com|org|...>`

e.g. `thunderclap-mydomain-com` is the KV namespace and script name associated with `thunderclap.mydomain.com`

You will need to populate a file `thunderclap.json` with many of your Cloudflare ids or keys. Copy the file 
`thunderclap.template.json` to `thunderclap.json` and replace the placeholder values. This will contain secret keys,
so you may want to move it out of your project directory to avoid having it checked-in. The `thunderclap` script in
`webpack.config.js` assumes the file is up one level in the directory tree. You will need to edit `webpack.config.js`
if you wish to put `thunderclap.json` elsewhere or load keys from environment variables.

You will need to place the file `db.json` at the root of your web server's public directory and `thunderclap.js` 
in your normal JavaScript resources directory. For convenience, `db.json` and `thunderclap.js` are located in the `docs` 
subdirectory of the repository so you can host them using GitHub Pages if you wish.

You can use Thunderclap without making any modifications by setting the `mode` in `thunderclap.json` to `production`
and running `npm run thunderclap`. This will deploy the Thunderclap worker and a route.

See the files in `docs` and `docs/test` for examples of using Thunderclap.

### Development

If you wish to modify Thunderclap, you must subscribe to the Cloudflare Argo tunneling service on the domain where 
you wish to use Thunderclap.

Create a Cloudflare Workers KV namespace using the Cloudflare Workders control panel. By convention the following 
name form is recommended so that the name parrallels the name of the worker script generated by the Thunderclap script 
`npm run thunderclap`.

`<devHost>-thunderclap-<primaryHostName>-<com|org|...>`

e.g. `myname-thunderclap-mydomain-com` is the KV namespace and script name associated with `myname-thunderclap.mydomain.com`

You do not need a CNAME record for your dev host, Argo manages this for you.

If the 'mode' in 'thunderclap.json` is set to `development`, then in addition to deploying the worker script to
`<devHost>-thunderclap-<primaryHostName>-<com|org|...>` with a route, a local web server is started with an Argo tunnel 
to access `<dev-host-prefix>-thunderclap.<your-domain>` via your web browser.

If you access `https://<dev-host-prefix>-thunderclap.<your-domain>/test/` via your web browser, the unit test file 
will load.

When in dev mode, files are watched by webpack and any changes cause a re-bundling and deployment of the worker script
to Cloudflare.

# Data Manipulation

Data in Thunderclap can be manipulated using a JavaScript client or CURL.

Unlike most JSON data stores, Thuderclap supports the storage of Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN. Dates are automatically 
serialized and de-serialized.

## JavaScript Client

```
<script src="thunderclap.js"></script>
<script>
const endpoint = "https://thunderclap.mydomain.com/db.json",
	username = "<get from somewhere>",
	password = "<get from somewhere>",
	db = new Thunderclap({endpoint,user:{username,password}});
</script>
```

`User async createUser(string userName,string password,reAuth)` - creates a user. The password is stored on the server
as an SHA-256 hash and salt. `createUser` can be called even if Thunderclap is started without a username and password. 
If this is done and `createUser` succeeds, the Thunderclap instance is bound to the new user for immediate authenticated 
use. If `reAuth` is truthy, the Thunderclap instance will also be re-bound to the new user. You can implement access 
control and account creation logic on the server to prevent the creation of un-authorized accounts. See the section 
Security.

`any async setItem(string key,any value)` - sets the `key` to `value`. If the `value` is an object it is NOT indexed.

`any async putItem(object value)` - adds a unique id on property "#" if one does not exist, indexes the object and 
stores it with `setItem` using the id as the key. In most cases the unique id will be of the form 
`<className>@xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`.

`any async getItem(string key)` - gets the value at `key`. Returns `undefined` if no value exists.

`undefined async removeItem(string|object keyOrObject) - removes the keyOrObject. If the argument is an indexed object 
or a key that resolves to an indexed object, the object is removed from the index. 

`Array async query(object JOQULARExpression)` - uses the index to find matching objects. See the unit
test `file docs/test/index.js` to understand the currently supported JOQULAR expressions and examples.

# Indexes

All properties of objects inserted using `putItem` are indexed. Objects that are just a value to `setItem` are 
not indexed. The index is not partitioned per class, it spans all classes.

At the moment one index is created for each unique property name, regardless of the class on which the property
exists. This index entry is a nested map of values and then object ids with the property and value, e.g.

```
{
	<value1>:
	{
		<objectid1>:true,
		<objectid2>:true,
		...
	}
	<value2>:
	{
		<objectid2>:true,
		...
	}
}
```

The root index node can be accessed via `getItem("!")`. Currently this is open to all, but it will be restricted
to the role `dbo` in the future. To get at a property index, just add the property name, e.g. `getItem("!userName")`.
Of course, you usually don't have to do this because the JOQULAR pattern processing engine in the worker script 
does it for you.

With the above, it is certainly possible to create an index that would be larger than the allowed RAM for a 
Cloudflare Worker.

At the expense of some additional reads, splitting the indexes so that each value is a separate entry in the 
KV store is certainly possible, and has been done in prototypes outside the scope of Cloudflare. The
node will then be reached something like this, `getItem("!userName!\"joe\"")`. 

This transition will be made with a move to BETA assuming performance is not hugely impacted. Conservatively, 50% of RAM will allow for 
terminal index nodes that contain references to 50,000,000 to 75,000,000 objects associated with a single property 
and value, e.g. 50,000,000 people called "joe". Only one terminal index node at a time is loaded by Thunderclap. 
The remaining RAM can be allocated to query results and code. Currently, the total size of Thuderclap worker code 
is less than 100K.

# Security

The Thunderclap security mechanisms support the application of role based read and write access rules at the object, 
property and storage key level. 

If a user is not authorized read access to an object or key value, it will not be returned. If a user is not 
authorized access to a particular property, the property will be stripped from the object before the
object is returned. Additionaly, a query for an object using properties to which a user does not have access
will automatically drop the properties from the selection process to prevent data leakage through inference.

If a user is not authorized write access to specific properties on an object, update attempts will 
fall back to partial updates on just those properties for which write access is allowed. If write access to a
key or an entire object is not allowed, the write will simply fail.

At the moment, by default, all keys, objects, and properties are available for read and write unless specifically
controlled in the `acl.js` file in the root of the Thunderclap repository. A future release will support defaulting
to prevent read and write unless specifically permitted.

See the file `acl.js` for more detail.

Roles can also be established in a tree that is automatically applied at runtime. See the file `roles.js`.

When Thunderclap is first initialized, a special user `User@dbo` with the user name `dbo` and password `dbo` is created
with the role `dbo`. In the future, it will be possible to set the password wiht the dev tools.

You can create additional accounts with the `createUser` method documented above.

It is not currently possible to change passwords, part of the reason for the Alpha status
of the project.

# History and Roadmap

Many of the concepts in Thunderclap were first explored in ReasonDB. ReasonDB development has been suspended for now, 
but many features found in ReasonDB will make their way into Thunderclap if interest is shown in the software. This
includes the addition of graph queries a la GunDB, full-text indexing, and joins.
